      <h2 class="head">While noting cops' role to protect, many Latinos also fear brutality</h2>
      
      <div class="story-body">
      <p><strong>By Kevin Simpson and Zahira Torres</strong><br>
      <em>The Denver Post</em></p>
      
      <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile the vast majority of Latinos subscribe to the traditional  notion that law enforcement exists to serve and protect, their confidence appears undermined by widespread concern about the use of excessive force.</p><p>Those findings illustrate the sometimes conflicting attitudes within a diverse population that encompasses more people who feel crime and violence have gotten worse in recent years than better, and who are more likely to think Latinos are usually treated unfairly  than fairly by law enforcement.</p><p>In a nationwide survey by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation,  84 percent of Latino respondents expressed the belief that police are there to protect. But   68 percent  also worried about brutality aimed at Latinos, and nearly one in five said they had friends, neighbors or relatives who had been targets of excessive force.</p><p>Cristina Varela, a mother of three children who participated in the poll, said she  welcomes the presence of police in her north Denver neighborhood but  sometimes struggles to reconcile her feelings of law enforcement as protector with instances of excessive force.</p><p>"Generally, you feel like if you are a Latino, you're marked," Varela said. "I saw police use excessive force in two instances but, you know with the police, you can't allege anything against them because at the end of the day they are the ones who will come out on top."</p><p>Fear of excessive force was highest among respondents with lower levels of education and income, and among undocumented individuals. But at least 43 percent of Latinos in all demographic subgroups expressed concern.</p><p>When it comes to relations with law enforcement, only a little more than one-fourth of those surveyed said Latinos are "usually" treated fairly, with 37 percent saying they are usually treated unfairly. The survey included border patrol authorities with other law enforcement.</p><p>Mike Butler, the public safety chief in Longmont, noted that perceptions of law enforcement can be shaped not only by media accounts of incidents across the country, but also by what immigrants experienced in their native lands.</p><p>"I've said for years that the sins of one agency are visited upon  all," Butler said. "When there's a high-profile event that occurs in any police department in this country that gets a tremendous amount of media attention."</p><p>Longmont was the scene of a high-profile police shooting in 1980 that left two Latino men dead and put a new focus on race relations. Since then, the city has made broad efforts to engage the Latino community.</p><p>Butler said the city has identified several organizations in the community where Latinos can find an advocate. A citizen review panel, with Latino representation, oversees internal disciplinary investigations.</p><p>"We recognize people come from countries where when it comes to the police or authorities, their experiences there could be carried over," Butler said. "We pay tremendous attention to making sure these folks feel they have a voice and belong to our community."</p><p>Overall, 43 percent of respondents to the survey nationwide said crime and violence had gotten worse over the last five years, compared to 26 percent who said conditions had improved. Low-earning Latinos and women were among those most likely to perceive that things had gotten worse, but that sentiment cut across other demographics as well. </p><p>The most negative view came from third-generation U.S. citizens, at 57 percent.</p><p>Marta Moreno has for decades helped lead an advocacy and social justice organization called El Comit&eacute; &mdash;  "The Committee" &mdash;  that grew out of the Longmont shooting. And while the group made constructive ties to local police in the aftermath of the shootings, she said, a chasm remains that keeps Latinos from engaging with law enforcement.</p><p>"A lot goes unreported because of fear, because they're immigrants, Latino or Chicano or however you categorize us," she said. "The system is not really trusted."</p><p>Among Latinos in the national survey, nearly 60 percent said they would change something about their local police department. Two of the most frequent items, after "better community policing," were to have cops treat people with respect and stop racism and discrimination.</p>
