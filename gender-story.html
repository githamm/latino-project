      <h2 class="head">Gender gap: Latino men, women see economic, social issues differently</h2>

      <em>The Denver Post</em></p>
      
      <p><span class="dropcap">K</span><p>evin Anton fields the text messages from his wife, Edna Ramos, all the time when she's out shopping, even on a quick grocery run. She will ask: <i>Can I get this?</i> And moments later send a follow-up: <i>Nevermind, I don't want to spend the money.</i></p><p>"The only times she does spend a little money is if the kids need something," says Anton, the first U.S.-born child of Nicaraguan immigrants. "But I give her the green light no matter what."</p><p>The stark difference in their attitudes about family finances reflects one of several gender gaps evident in the results of a W.K. Kellogg Foundation survey of Latino households on a various aspects of American life.</p><p>On economic matters, a majority of  men (54 percent) and a plurality of women (47 percent) felt that their personal finances were at least somewhat better than five years ago.</p><p>But, when looked at separately, men expressed a significantly higher sense &mdash;  7 percentage points &mdash;  that their economic fortunes had gotten at least somewhat better over the last five years. Women, meanwhile,  were much more likely to be at least somewhat worried &mdash;  by 12 points &mdash;  about someone in the household losing their job.</p><p>"Edna won't spend 10 bucks on chicken because she thinks we're struggling now and then," Anton said. "I'm a lot more optimistic these last five years."</p><p>Nearly half of women and men surveyed agreed that access to health care had improved. Still, women were much more likely than men to see access to health care and affordable housing as worse than it was five years ago.  Men were more likely to be dissatisfied with the way the government has dealt with immigration policy.</p><p>When it comes to race relations, women were significantly more likely than men to feel that the country has gotten worse at treating everyone with dignity and respect. And by a similar 6-point margin they're more likely to   feel that anti-Latino and anti-immigrant attitudes have deteriorated.</p><p>Men had a slightly less positive view of education. Although nearly one-third of respondents of both genders see public education as essentially unchanged, women were significantly more likely to feel it has gotten better and men more likely to think it had gotten worse.</p>

      </ul><p>Crime and violence prompted a  yawning gender gap: women &mdash; by 11 percentage points over men &mdash; felt the situation surrounding safety had gotten worse.</p><p>Sophia Maldonado, a 45-year-old survey respondent who lives in Denver's Five Points neighborhood, said that at least part of the reason women appear less hopeful  about reducing crime and violence stems from the way they network and communicate.</p><p>"Everybody around here keeps up on crime," she said. "Violence around here is just sad. Guys are like, whatever. If something happens, it happens. Women, we feel this <i>can't</i> happen. We've got to see what's going on." </p><p>Women were less likely than men to describe their health as somewhere from fair to excellent and also more likely to visit a health provider at least somewhat regularly.</p><p>Jim Garcia, executive director of Clinica Tepeyac in north Denver, where 70 percent of the patients are women, said Latinas' perspectives likely offer a more accurate reflection of their own health and that of their families .</p><p>"Latinas are definitely the gatekeepers for their families," Garcia said, "and they are much more in tune with the needs of their children." </p><p>That traditional female gender role could also offer insight into reasons behind disparities surrounding economic outlooks.</p><p>Gail Christopher, vice president for policy and senior advisor to the Kellogg Foundation, noted that in some cases, particularly low-income families, much of the household responsibility falls on women.</p><p>"With the experience of a mother with children in a low economic strata," she said, "where labor is episodic and you usually need two people to meet economic needs of the family, you're going to have a great deal of stress being carried by the mother." </p><p>But even in more affluent circumstances, women can find themselves with fewer opportunities &mdash;  and a less rosy view of economic prospects.</p><p>"When I started, I thought this is great. I'm really excited to be here. I worked incredibly hard to get here and I'll give it my best," said Meshach Rhoades, a Denver-based attorney. "But I'm not all that optimistic that in 10 years or in 15 years that I'm going to have those same opportunities."</p>
