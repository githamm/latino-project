      <h2 class="head">Latinos say health care options have improved, but challenges remain</h2>
      
      <div class="story-body">
      <p><strong>By Kevin Simpson and Zahira Torres</strong><br>
      <em>The Denver Post</em></p>
      
      <p><span class="dropcap">A</span><p>14-year-old Latina stepped into North Denver's Clinica Tepeyac on a recent weekday gaunt and barely able to see because of the cataracts that had developed in both of her eyes &mdash; a result of advanced diabetes that was not properly treated.</p>
      <p>"The assumption was that she wasn't eligible for care. That's why the parents didn't get her in sooner," said Jim Garcia, the nonprofit clinic's executive director. "She was born here and should have been able to take advantage of the full range of services to treat her diabetes but, because the parents had that hesitancy and fear, they brought her in at a very late stage."</p>
      <p>Garcia said the staff at Clinica Tepeyac works daily to combat misconceptions and a lack of understanding related to navigating the health care system that keep some patients from seeking immediate treatment. While challenges remain, Garcia said access to health care options has improved &mdash; a view  shared by a majority of Latino families surveyed in a national, wide-ranging poll conducted by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. </p>
      <p>The poll found that nearly half of Latinos feel the country is doing better at providing access to health care than it was five years ago. Almost half surveyed also said they "regularly" visited a health care provider. A large majority said their provider was located conveniently and had Spanish speakers available. </p>
      <p>Deniz Kolozs, a Kaiser Permanente pediatrician who works in Aurora, said Latino families at her clinic are not only engaged but place a high value on her professional opinion. Kolozs said she chose to work with the Latino community because she believed her fluency in Spanish would help remove barriers to treating children. </p>
      <p>"When it comes to the health care of your children, I think you need to hear it in a language that you understand," she said.</p>
      <p>Although the poor or uninsured often seek care at hospital emergency rooms or urgent care centers, relatively few Latinos surveyed said they did so &mdash;  only 10 percent at ERs and 3 percent at urgent care locations. More than half said they go to a doctor's office or private clinic and 25 percent go to a community health clinic. </p>
      <p>About 25 percent of Latinos in Colorado are uninsured, compared with 14 percent of African Americans and 11 percent of whites, according to 2013 estimates from the U.S. Censusâ€™ American Community Survey.</p>
      <p>And while fewer than half of those surveyed said they were familiar with the Affordable Care Act, 75 percent indicated they currently have health insurance, with another 12 percent planning to sign up and only 9 percent uninsured with no plans to sign up. </p>

      <p>Monica Acosta, lead health justice organizer for Padres y Jovenes Unidos in Denver, said the 75 percent figure sounds high, even for the Latino community beyond the low-income group she serves. But she has little doubt that the numbers are increasing. </p>
      <p>She added that President Barack Obama's deferred action program that offers some here illegally protection from deportation and a chance to work has encouraged more employers to offer insurance, prompting more Latinos to become enrolled.</p>
      <p>According to the U.S. Department of Health Human Services, one out of every four uninsured people in the country is Latino, but about 2.6 million Latinos have received health insurance coverage since the start of the Affordable Care Act, cutting the number of uninsured by 7.7 percentage points.</p>
      <p>Latinos are less prone to heart disease than whites, despite more risk factors such as higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Nearly 32 percent of Latinos were obese in 2010, compared with 26 percent for whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>Gail Christopher, vice president for policy and senior advisor to the Kellogg Foundation, said the poll and those national indicators point to what is known as the "Latino paradox." </p>
      <p>"When people come to this country, particularly Latino immigrants, they are healthier in the first generation and sometimes the second generation," Christopher said.</p>
      <p>Latinos overwhelmingly described themselves as being in fair to excellent health &mdash;  with 87 percent falling into that range. That self-reporting sounded "a little bit shocking" to Acosta, perhaps reflecting people's reluctance to admit to medical issues.</p><p> "When we're out in the community talking to mostly parents in Denver, mostly immigrant, Spanish-speaking monolingual," she said, "I would say that answer would be very different."</p>
